### About me

I'm a biomedical engineer working towards my PhD in biomedical imaging at the University of Southampton.

My project aims to improve image-based biomedical research and clinical decision-making with [3D X-ray Histology](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/muvis/xrh/index.page). I develop bioimage analysis workflows for correlative X-ray micro-computed tomography and whole slide images.
